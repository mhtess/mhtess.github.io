# Causals experiments

## Causals 1

A pilot test of the 2-stage (prior + posterior) task.
4 trials / participant
Posterior task is: Speaker / listener between-subjects.
- one story, one distribution, one frequency (when speaker)

n = 9 ($0.50)

+ 63 ($37.80) [7 batches of 9]

## Causals 2

Similar to pilot 1.
Removed a bunch of the prose, and beefed up the tabular representation of the data.
(Note: May want to run a comprehension check on their "table reading" skills.)

4 trials / participant (as before)

Now, prior task is a separate between-subjects condition, so each participant does only prior, listener, or speaker task.
Prior task also is not "structured prior" used in Prior 1. It's just a posterior predictive question.
Speaker task is also a slider (to get more bits from pilot data; plan is to return to 2AFC in final production version, for ease of data analysis).

Dropping pay a little because there are substantially fewer questions.

n = 63 ($30.24, including fees) [7 batches of 9]

## Causals 3

Endorsement task only.

- 1 trial / participant.
- 1 item.
- 3 distributions: {rare, accidental, prevalent}
- 2 AFC.
- Estimated 30 participants / condition --> 90 participants.
- $0.25 / participant x 90 = (0.25*90) + (0.25*90*0.2) = 27

## Causals 4

Endorsement task only.

Same as causals 3, except the table disappears when the participant is presented with information about the final experiment and asked to judge the statement.

- 1 trial / participant.
- 1 item.
- 3 distributions: {rare, accidental, prevalent}
- 2 AFC.
- Estimated 30 participants / condition --> 90 participants.
- $0.25 / participant x 90 = (0.25*90) + (0.25*90*0.2) = 27

## Causals 5

Endorsement task and prior task.

Expanding causals 4.

+ 2 more items (physical and behavioral)
+ Prior task where participants give 4 ratings on never-before-seen compounds (i.e., predictions)

- 1 trial / participant.
- 3 item.
- 2 distributions: {rare, accidental}
- 2 AFC / 4 x sliders
- Estimated 20 participants / domain (3) x distribution (2) x condition (2) --> 240 participants.
- $0.25 / participant x 240 = (0.25*240) + (0.25*240*0.2) = 72

Some errors in deplyoment. Didn't get equal counts in all cells.

## Causals 6

5/6/17

Prior task.

+ 2 items: blicket detector and metal rusting.
+ 1 distribution: rare (0s and 10s)
+ only 3 data points from distribution
+ 6 x sliders on predictions

- Estimated 20 participants / 2 x item --> 40 participants.
- $0.25 / participant x 40 = (0.25*40) + (0.25*40*0.2) = 12


## Causals 7

#### Endorsement / interpretation / prior tasks.

+ 3 items: Dissolving rocks, growing plants, sleepy animals (but not looking for domain differences)
+ 6 distributions: rare_weak, rare_strong, rare_deterministic, common_weak, common_strong, weak_or_strong
+ 3 frequencies (endorsement only)

#### Unique conditions:

- Prior: 6 distributions
- Interpretation: 6 distributions
- Endorsement: 6 distributions x 2 frequencies = 12

Total unique conditions = 24

Pilot N's:

- Prior and interpretation each get n = 20
- Endorsement get n = 25

- Prior: 6 x 20 = 120 * $0.25 + 20% = $36
- Interpretation: 6 x 20 = 120 * $0.25 + 20% = $36
- Endorsement: 12 x 25 = 300 * $0.25 + 20% = $90

Total N = 300 + 120 + 120 = 540

Cost = 540 * 0.25 = 135 + 27 = 162

## Causals 8

### Endorsement task

- Prior: 4 distributions (rare vs. common X weak vs. deterministic)
- 1 Frequency (20)
- Add catch trial at end
- Make distributions more random looking (no round numbers)
- n = 50 / distribution

Cost = 200 * 0.25 = 50 + 10 = 60

5/18/2017
+ 1 frequency (70)
+ 200 participants

### Prior measurement

- Prior: 4 distributions (rare vs. common X weak vs. deterministic)
- comparable to endorsement task
- n = 40 / distribution

Cost = 160 * 0.25 = 40 + 8 = 48
(17 batches + batch of 7)
