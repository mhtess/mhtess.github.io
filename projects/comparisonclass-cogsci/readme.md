# Comparison class experiments

1. `class-elicitation-2afc` (n = 300; January 15, 2017)
A 2-alternative forced-choice version of the `class-elicitation` task used in the pilots.
We the 2afc for ease of the (Bayesian) data analysis.
Since each participant only does one-half of trials, we will collect about 150 participants to get approximately 75 responses for item.
We choose n = 75 responses on a 2AFC to produce confidence intervals with a maximum width of about 0.2-0.25.
This is quantitative experiment and we are interested in the precision of our estimates for each item.
The task involves 15 2-afc trials and I expect will take < 5 minutes.
Since each participant completes half of all trials for a single condition, we will need N = 300.
We will pay each participant $0.50 for the experiment.

36 participants were accidentally collected on a slider version of the task and must be dropped.
Another 2 participants failed the simple catch trial at the start, leaving n = 262.

2. `vague-prior-elicitation-2afc` (n = 100; January 16, 2017)
Same data collection plan as above.
In these experiments, the participant knows the subordinate category ("Johns sees a basketball player").
Participants are asked if the adjective with an explicit superordinate comparison class would be appropriate (e.g., Do you think the basketball player would be considered tall relative to other people?")
